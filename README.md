# CplxNtwrk2023

This is a repository for homeworks, projects and exercises for *Diffusion Processes on Complex Networks* course by J. Szawbinski and T. Weron at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology. 

All solutions by Kacper Kinastowski

## Assignments list: 
1. **Introduction to networks and graph theory** - nothing special:)
2. **Implementation of graph structure** - my own implementation of graph class similar to [`NetworkX1](https://github.com/networkx/networkx).
3. **Analysis of real and artificial networks** - this project consists of analysis of artificial networks (random, Barabasi-Alberts, Watts-Strogatz) and real a network. Real network is a network of redditors and subreddits connected with subreddit [`r/Python`](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/). The network was obtained through my application: [`RedditUserScraper`](https://github.com/kkinastowski66/RedditUserScarpper) (i strongly recommend to play a little bit with this one!),
4. **Random walks** - random walks in 2D and on graphs
5. **SIR (pandemic models)** - SIR model (ODE) and pandemy on graphs models
6. **Q-Voter model**
